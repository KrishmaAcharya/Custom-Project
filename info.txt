@yeild('content')
In Blade, Laravel's templating engine, @yield is used to define a section of content that can be replaced by child views. When you create a layout (like the one you've shown), you can use @yield to specify where the content from child views should be inserted.

For example, in your layout:

<body>
    @include('layout.navigation')
    @yield('content')
</body>
The @yield('content') directive acts as a placeholder. In a child view, you would use @section to define the content for that section:

@extends('layout.master')

@section('content')
    <h1>This is the child view content!</h1>
@endsection
When this child view is rendered, the content inside the @section('content') will replace the @yield('content') in the layout. This allows for a flexible and reusable structure in your Blade templates.
